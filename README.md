Prediction of Stock price using RNNs. Prediction of day N is based on day N-60 to N-59.

## In preprocessing phase, the data is normalized by MinMaxScaler of Scikitlearn, to enahance the performance of Deep Learning Model.

## Deep Learning model is made by Keras LSTM, Dropout (to prevent overfitting) and 100 epochs of training.
